# InspireU: Ecosystem and Sustainability Project

## Project Overview

Welcome to InspireU, where we are committed to preserving our planet for future generations through innovative technology and sustainable practices. This project focuses on various aspects of ecosystem and sustainability, providing tools and features to make a positive impact.

## Features

### 1. Plant Recommendation System

Our machine learning model recommends plants for your garden based on your budget and preferred plant types. Additionally, it suggests combinations of plants within your budget for a thriving garden. The recommended plants can be used to place orders directly from nearby nurseries by entering them in the query section.

### 2. Sustainable Energy and Electric Car Support

- **Renewable Energy Calculator:** Determine your monthly electricity consumption and discover how many solar panels are required to meet your electricity needs. Get an estimate of the total cost of these solar panels and find an Amazon link to purchase them, making sustainable energy accessible.

- **Electric Car Enthusiast Recognition and Learning:** Are you an electric car owner? Your commitment to the environment deserves recognition. In our leaderboard, your name will be highlighted, and you'll receive an "Environment Savior" badge.
-  Additionally, you can access important information about renewable energy, including Wikipedia links, by clicking the "Learn More about renewable energy" button on the leaderboard.


### 3. Environmental Reporting and Cattle Management

Help improve your city's environment by uploading images of land waste and sightings of unknown cattle on roads. Government officials can access this data for appropriate action, reducing land pollution and enhancing cattle management while reducing traffic and accidents.


### 4. Localized Weather Forecasts

Our Localized Weather Forecasts webpage provides hyper-localized weather forecasts. This feature aids farmers and communities in planning agricultural activities and disaster preparedness by offering precise weather information for their specific regions.
